*discord.gg/project-rain*

**NOTICE:**
*this script still works without (maybe) instant ban since is does not modify anything.*

**how it works:**
*1.looks for the chest/lootbag ui
2.fire the remote that would be fired if you click a item
3.if you select a box on the ui it looks on the ui for anything named with name and 4.fires the remote and picks it up
5. theres all items from they rarity and weaponary/hats/gems etc*

**this script is not fully up to date with anything after March 2024**

*if you want me to update the script you can basically ping me inside the project rain discord*

**WILL IT BE UPDATED?:**
*if theres many ppl wanting to have this fully working all items etc after the day finishing this you can always let me know pinging on project rain this script remains free forever and even if it gets updated it prolly will not cost money*
